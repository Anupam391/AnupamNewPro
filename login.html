    <a href="">🐯 Tiger ! = $.2999</a>
<p>Tiger belongs to the family of cats. It is a wild animal, and we can see it either in the forest or in a Zoo. An average tiger is about 4 meters long with a weight of 600 pounds. IT has a life span of about 15 years, but it can live for 25 years when held in captivity. The tiger is an Asian animal, and its origin in Africa is just a myth. Some Asian Tigers, like South Chinese Tiger, had migrated to Africa very early.

The tiger stays active during the day as well as at the night. It is an excellent swimmer, and it bathes every day to stay cool. The word 'Tigress' denotes the female tiger, while the word 'Cub' is an indication of a young tiger. The tiger lives within a large territory, and it marks its territory by spraying urine on the trees.</p>
